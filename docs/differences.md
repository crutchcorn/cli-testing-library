title: "Differences Between CLI Testing Library & Testing Library"
---

While we clearly take inspiration from
[`DOM Testing Library`](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library)
and
[`React Testing Library`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library),
and try to do our best to align as much as possible, there are some major
distinctions between the project's APIs.

# Instances

While the `DOM Testing Library` and it's descendants have a concept of both a
`container` and `element`, `CLI Testing Library` only has a single concept to
replace them both: a `TestInstance`.

This is because, while the DOM makes a clear distinction between different
elements (say,
[`HTMLBodyElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLBodyElement)
and
[`HTMLDivElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDivElement)),
there is no such distinction between processes in the CLI as far as I'm aware.

While this may change in the future (maybe `container` can be a sort of
`TestProcess` of some kind), there are
[unanswered questions around what that API looks like and whether we can meaningfully handle the distinction](https://github.com/crutchcorn/cli-testing-library/issues/2).

# Queries

Similarly, `HTMLElement`s provide clean lines between user input items.
Meanwhile, the CLI only has the concepts of `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`.
It's unclear how matching a single line of `stdout` would help in a beneficial
matter, much less how APIs like `fireEvent` would utilize this seemingly
extraneous metadata.

As a result, we don't have any `*AllBy` queries that `DOM Testing Library` does.
All of our queries are non-plural (`*By`) and will simply return either the test
instance the query was called on, or `null` depending on the query.

While we would be happy to reconsider, there are once again
[lots of questions around what `*AllBy` queries would like and whether we can meaningfully use that concept](https://github.com/crutchcorn/cli-testing-library/issues/2).

# Events

Another area where we diverge from the DOM is in our event system (as
implemented via `fireEvent` and `userEvent`).

Despite our APIs' naming indicating an actual event system (complete with
bubbling and more, like the DOM), the CLI has no such concept.

### FireEvent

This means that, while `fireEvent` in the `DOM Testing Library` has the ability
to inherent from all baked-into-browser events, we must hard-code a list of
"events" and actions a user may take.

We try our best to implement ones that make sense:

- `fireEvent.write({value: str})` to write `str` into stdin
- `fireEvent.sigkill()` to send a
  [sigkill](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)#SIGKILL>) to the process
- `fireEvent.sigint()` to send a
  [sigint](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)#SIGINT>) to the process

There is a missing API for that might make sense in `keypress`. It's unclear
what this behavior would do that `write` wouldn't be able to.

### UserEvent

There's also the API of `userEvent` that allows us to implement a fairly similar
`keyboard` event
[to upstream](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event/#keyboardtext-options).
However, there are a few differences here as well:

1. `userEvent` can be bound to the `render` output. This is due to limitations
   of not having a `screen` API. It's unclear how this would work in practice,
   due to a lack of the `window` API.
2. `userEvent.keyboard` does not support modifier keys. It's only key-presses,
   no holding. This is because of API differences that would require us to
   figure out a manual binding system for every single key using ANSI AFAIK.
3. Relatedly, we've remove the `{` syntax support, since there is no standard
   keybinding for the CLI,
   [like there is for the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code).
   Instead, we only support `[` and `]` syntax.

# Matchers

While most of this document has been talking about `DOM Testing Library` and
`React Testing Library`, let's take a moment to talk about
[`jest-dom`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) matchers.

Usually, in a Testing Library testbed, you'd expect a `getByText` to look
something like this:

```javascript
const {getByText} = render(/* Something */)

expect(getByText('Hello World')).toBeInTheDocument()
```

In today's version of `CLI Testing Library`, the same would look something like
this:

```javascript
const {getByText} = render(/* Something */)

expect(getByText('Hello World')).toBeInTheConsole()
```

# Similarities

None of this is to say that we're not dedicated to being aligned with upstream.
We would love to work with the broader Testing Library community to figure out
these problems and adjust our usage.

This is the primary reason the library is still published as an `@alpha`,
despite being stable enough to successfully power
[a popular CLI application](https://github.com/plopjs/plop/)'s testbed.

What's more, we're dedicated enough to making this happen that we've made sure
to:

- Use the same source code organization (as much as possible) as
  `DOM Testing Library` and `React Testing Library`
- Use the same deployment process as `DOM Testing Library`
- Use similar documentation styles

And more!
